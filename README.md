# My Very First Web Page

Welcome:

## PROJECT 1:

- The project that we have been asked to do entails creating website links using clickable images.
- These images are all based around types of code and code related websites.
- The user clicks on the image and the embedded link takes them to a wikipedia page for further info on the image.

## What was required:

- We were asked to make 3 streams(pages).<br>
- Each stream contained up to 6 links.<br>
- Each link was to be represented by a clickable logo and a clickable underlined description. <br>
- We had to find all the images on google and write the code to place them uniformly on the page. <br>
- This was all done in C9 before being pushed onto Github for general access.

## The technologies used

##### 1. Cloud9
###### This was used for writing the code. 
##### 2. Github
###### This was used to host the website and store its data.
##### 3. Google
###### This was used to locate the required icons and links. 
##### 4. Slack
###### This was used to communicate with other students to troubleshoot problems when they were encountered.

## The rationale behind the project:
This project was designed to give us an introduction to creating websites using C9 to write it and Github to host it.
